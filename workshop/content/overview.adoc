== Ansible Automation Platform 2 EDA on OpenShift

Welcome to the Ansible Automation Platform 2 Event Driven Ansible (EDA) on
OpenShift Lab. This comprehensive lab experience is designed to provide you with
an understanding of the capabilities of Ansible Rulebooks in the context of an
OpenShift environment.

The lab is divided into three key exercises, each focusing on a specific aspect
of EDA within an OpenShift environment.

*Exercise 1: Persistent Volume Snapshots Management* - In this exercise,
you will learn the process of automatically creating Volume Snapshots
when a Persistent Volume Claim is created by an application. This section
provides a detailed overview of the interaction between Ansible Rulebooks and
how watching for specific events can trigger an Automation Job to create the
generation of Volume Snapshots.

*Exercise 2: SSL Management and Let's Encrypt Certificates Integration* - This
exercise delves into SSL Management and demonstrates the practical application
of integrating Let's Encrypt Certificates with OpenShift applications upon their
creation. Participants will gain insights into enhancing the security of their
applications through the effective use of SSL certificates.

*Exercise 3: Resource Quota Allocation in a Shared OpenShift Environment* - The
final exercise emphasizes the importance of resource management in scenarios
where an OpenShift cluster is shared across an organization. You will
learn how to set resource quotas when creating a new namespace, ensuring that
resources are fairly distributed and not over-consumed by any specific team.
